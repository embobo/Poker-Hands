# Poker-Hands
simple poker hand comparator using C# .NET 

## PokerHands
project containing data structures and methods for holding cards, 
processing hand strength, and evaluating the winner of a set of hands.

#### Notes

- If doing this again, I would make the CardValue and CardSuit enums
classes such that they could contain their own methods for string 
conversion

## PokerHandsTest
unit test project for testing the classes in PokerHands.

## PokerHandsAPI
project for running the program and setting up an http listener to get 
and respond to http requests.
